Problem: Check if an array can be divided into pairs whose sum is divisible by k

Description: Given an array of integers and a number k, write a function that returns true if
given array can be divided into pairs such that sum of every pair is divisible by k.

Examples:
1. Input: arr[] = {9, 7, 5, 3}, k = 6
   Output: True
   We can divide array into (9, 3) and (7, 5). Sum of both of these pairs is a multiple of 6.
2. Input: arr[] = {92, 75, 65, 48, 45, 35}, k = 10
   Output: True
   We can divide array into (92, 48), (75, 65) and (45, 35). Sum of all these pairs is a multiple
   of 10.
3. Input: arr[] = {91, 74, 66, 48}, k = 10
   Output: False
